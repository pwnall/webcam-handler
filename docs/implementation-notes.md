# webcam-handler — Implementation notes

Case law. Recorded, justified deviations from docs/1–5 land here as numbered **N-entries**;
new hardware behavior lands here as **PF-entries continuing the docs/1 §1.2 registry**.
Reviews do not re-report an entry; they retire one only on empirical disproof.

Each entry states: what the doc says, what the repo does, why, and what would retire it.

---

## N1 — The lint policy lives in `[workspace.lints]`, and tests are not exempt

**Doc:** docs/4 writes the crate-root lint policy with
`#![cfg_attr(not(test), deny(clippy::allow_attributes, clippy::allow_attributes_without_reason))]`
— test code exempt from the suppression-hygiene lints.

**Repo:** the whole policy is one `[workspace.lints]` table in the root `Cargo.toml`, and
every crate opts in with `[lints] workspace = true`. Cargo's lints table cannot express
`cfg(test)`, so the two suppression-hygiene lints apply to test code as well.

**Why:** the alternative is thirteen hand-maintained copies of the same attribute block —
a second copy of a law, which rubric A5 calls a finding, in the one place docs/4 also
demands the policy be uniform. The deviation is strictly *stronger* than the documented
policy (test code must write `#[expect(..., reason = "...")]` too), so nothing it changes
can weaken a gate.

**Retires when:** Cargo grows cfg-conditional lint tables, or the test-side strictness
proves to cost more than it buys (measured in suppressions written, not in irritation).

**Adjacent:** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is *not* in the workspace table, because
`webcam-handler-v4l2` must not have it. It stays a crate-root attribute on the other
twelve, and `scripts/gates/unsafe-scope.sh` asserts each root carries it — so the copies
are gate-checked, not trusted.

---

## N2 — `directories` is not used; the two XDG paths are ours

**Doc:** design §2.8 lists `directories 6` among the core picks.

**Repo:** no dependency. `webcam-handler-engine::paths` resolves `$XDG_STATE_HOME`
(fallback `$HOME/.local/state`) and `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` directly.

**Why:** `directories 6.0.0 → dirs-sys 0.5.0 → option-ext 0.2.0`, and `option-ext` is
**MPL-2.0**. The license allowlist rejected it on the scaffold's first `cargo deny` run —
the gate paid for itself before a single line of domain code existed. The crate is on the
ban list now, with this note as the reason, so it cannot return by accident.

We need exactly two paths, both fixed by one paragraph of the XDG Base Directory
specification, on one platform. Vendoring a cross-platform path library to get them is a
worse trade than owning thirty lines.

**Retires when:** `directories` sheds `option-ext` (upstream has an open issue about it),
or the tool grows a real need for cross-platform path conventions.

---

## N3 — `std::thread::sleep` is banned workspace-wide, not just in tests

**Doc:** docs/4's `disallowed-methods` bans `std::thread::sleep` *in test code*.

**Repo:** `clippy.toml` is a workspace-global file with no notion of test-vs-not, so the
ban is global. Legitimate production sites (there are none yet; a settle backoff would be
one) take a narrow `#[expect(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "…")]`.

**Why:** the same one-home argument as N1. A global ban with named exceptions is auditable
— `grep` finds every exception and each carries a reason; a test-only ban is not.

**Retires when:** clippy grows per-target `disallowed-methods`.

## N4 — The D13 registry gained four variants

**Doc:** design D13 lists fourteen error variants and calls the registry closed.

**Repo:** `webcam-handler-schema::error::Error` has eighteen. The four additions:

| Variant | Why the fourteen could not cover it |
|---|---|
| `CameraUnknown { requested }` | `wch photo cam:nope` has to fail as something. D13 has `DeviceGone` (a camera that *was* there) but nothing for a name that never resolved. |
| `CameraAmbiguous { requested, candidates }` | D1 grants prefix resolution (`cam:obsbot`); a prefix matching two cameras must name both, and no existing variant carries candidates. |
| `DeviceIo { operation, errno, message }` | D13 maps `EBUSY`, `EPERM` and `ENODEV` to typed variants, which leaves every other `errno` — `EINVAL` on a format negotiation, `EIO` mid-stream — with nowhere to land except an `anyhow` string, and rubric B6 calls a string crossing the wire a finding. |
| `StorageIo { path, errno, message }` | D9's own fault menu lists "full disk", and the fourteen have no variant for a filesystem failure. |

**Why this is completion rather than re-litigation:** D13's stated purpose is that "every
variant carries what the caller needs to act", and the closed-ness is what makes the
`webcam-handler-api` code mapping exhaustive. Both additions of the `*Io` pair keep that
property — they are typed, they carry `errno` and the operation, and a caller can
distinguish them from a capability answer (E3). The alternative was a stringly escape
hatch, which would have broken the doctrine the registry exists to hold.

`ErrorKind` is generated with its `ALL` by the `closed_vocabulary!` macro, and
`Error::kind()` is an exhaustive match, so every one of the eighteen is walked by the
round-trip, rendering, and (from P4) RPC-code tests. Adding a nineteenth without wiring it
in does not compile.

**Retires when:** nothing retires it; docs/1 D13 should absorb these four at its next
revision. Recorded here rather than edited into the design because the design is v1 and
this is repo case law (docs/2's standing conventions).

## N5 — `webcam-handler-api` is exempt from the tokio half of the T6 wall

**Doc:** design §2.8 states the purity wall as "`schema`, `imaging`, `fake`, `api`,
`cli-core` link no tokio/axum/hyper", gate-asserted from `cargo metadata`.

**Repo:** `scripts/gates/dependency-walls.sh` applies the full three-crate ban to
`schema`, `imaging`, `fake` and `cli-core`. `webcam-handler-api` gets its own wall —
**no axum, no hyper, no tower-http** — and is allowed tokio.

**Why:** measured on 2026-08-08 against jsonrpsee 0.26.0, three feature sets built in a
scratch crate containing nothing but a `#[rpc(server, client)]` trait:

| `jsonrpsee` features | Result |
|---|---|
| `macros` | does not compile — the expansion needs `IntoResponse` and `RpcModule` |
| `macros`, `client-core` | does not compile — the server half is unresolved |
| `macros`, `server-core` | does not compile — the client half is unresolved |
| `macros`, `client-core`, `server-core` | compiles; `jsonrpsee-core → tokio` (`rt`, `sync`, `time`, `macros`) |

`jsonrpsee-core` activates tokio in *both* its `client` and `server` features, and the
macro's expansion references it. So a crate holding one `#[rpc(server, client)]` trait
links tokio, necessarily. Making the features optional on our side does not help either:
the two composition roots enable them and cargo unifies.

That leaves three options. Splitting the trait so client and server halves live in
separate crates would give us two wire surfaces, which is the thing D10/T5 exists to
prevent. Hand-rolling JSON-RPC is §7's recorded "shape of last resort" and costs us the
80% of jsonrpsee we actually use. Narrowing the wall costs us the least, provided the
narrowing is to exactly what the wall was protecting.

**What the wall was protecting**, read from §2.8's own sentence: "only `daemon` links the
web stack". That property is intact and now gate-asserted for `api` specifically —
measured today, `api` pulls no axum, no hyper, no tower. Tokio arriving as a transitive
library dependency of a JSON-RPC codec is not the defect the rule was written against;
`wchc` linking hyper would be, and that half still fails loudly.

**What is not covered:** that `api` never *starts* a runtime or spawns a task. Linkage
cannot see that. It joins the behavioral halves of T6 that §2.8 already declares
review-held — so this note widens the review surface by one claim rather than pretending
the gate grew.

**Retires when:** jsonrpsee splits a runtime-free core out of `jsonrpsee-core`, or the
wire surface stops being jsonrpsee. Re-run the table above on any jsonrpsee bump; if a
version makes the original wall satisfiable, delete the exemption and this note.

## PF:13 — `bus_info` is per-USB-device, not per-logical-camera

**Measured** 2026-08-08 on kernel 7.0.0-29-generic, against the same seed hardware as the
docs/1 §1.2 registry. Continues that registry; cite it as `[PF:13]`.

`VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` reports `bus_info` for both Chicony logical cameras as the identical
string `usb-0000:00:14.0-4`, even though they are separate USB *interfaces* (`3-4:1.0` RGB
and `3-4:1.2` IR) hosting separate capture nodes with different formats. The card names do
differ (`Integrated Camera: Integrated C` vs `… Integrated I`), but that is the vendor's
courtesy, not a guarantee.

**Consequences, both load-bearing:**

1. **Grouping must come from the sysfs USB interface path**, never from `bus_info` —
   PF:7's rule, now with the counter-example that shows why the easier field does not
   work. Two cameras that share `bus_info` would collapse into one group.
2. **`CameraFingerprint::bus_path` holds the interface path** (`3-4:1.2`), not `bus_info`.
   A fingerprint built on `bus_info` could not tell the IR camera from the RGB one, and
   `calibrate apply` would happily replay an IR session onto the RGB sensor.

Measured node facts, for the P1 enumeration tests:

| Node | Interface | `device_caps` | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| video0 | 3-4:1.0 | `0x04200001` | capture (Chicony RGB) |
| video1 | 3-4:1.0 | `0x04a00000` | metadata |
| video2 | 3-4:1.2 | `0x04200001` | capture (Chicony IR) |
| video3 | 3-4:1.2 | `0x04a00000` | metadata |
| video4 | 3-1:1.0 | `0x04200001` | capture (OBSBOT Tiny 3) |
| video5 | 3-1:1.0 | `0x04a00000` | metadata |

USB ids: Chicony `04f2:b83c` serial `"0001"`; OBSBOT `3564:ff02`, no serial — PF:8 holds.

**Retires when:** never, unless the kernel starts reporting per-interface `bus_info`. It
becomes corpus at P1, where the three committed profiles pin these node tables.
