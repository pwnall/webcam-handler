# webcam-handler — Implementation notes

Case law. Recorded, justified deviations from docs/1–5 land here as numbered **N-entries**;
new hardware behavior lands here as **PF-entries continuing the docs/1 §1.2 registry**.
Reviews do not re-report an entry; they retire one only on empirical disproof.

Each entry states: what the doc says, what the repo does, why, and what would retire it.

---

## N1 — The lint policy lives in `[workspace.lints]`, and tests are not exempt

**Doc:** docs/4 writes the crate-root lint policy with
`#![cfg_attr(not(test), deny(clippy::allow_attributes, clippy::allow_attributes_without_reason))]`
— test code exempt from the suppression-hygiene lints.

**Repo:** the whole policy is one `[workspace.lints]` table in the root `Cargo.toml`, and
every crate opts in with `[lints] workspace = true`. Cargo's lints table cannot express
`cfg(test)`, so the two suppression-hygiene lints apply to test code as well.

**Why:** the alternative is thirteen hand-maintained copies of the same attribute block —
a second copy of a law, which rubric A5 calls a finding, in the one place docs/4 also
demands the policy be uniform. The deviation is strictly *stronger* than the documented
policy (test code must write `#[expect(..., reason = "...")]` too), so nothing it changes
can weaken a gate.

**Retires when:** Cargo grows cfg-conditional lint tables, or the test-side strictness
proves to cost more than it buys (measured in suppressions written, not in irritation).

**Adjacent:** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is *not* in the workspace table, because
`webcam-handler-v4l2` must not have it. It stays a crate-root attribute on the other
twelve, and `scripts/gates/unsafe-scope.sh` asserts each root carries it — so the copies
are gate-checked, not trusted.

---

## N2 — `directories` is not used; the two XDG paths are ours

**Doc:** design §2.8 lists `directories 6` among the core picks.

**Repo:** no dependency. `webcam-handler-engine::paths` resolves `$XDG_STATE_HOME`
(fallback `$HOME/.local/state`) and `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` directly.

**Why:** `directories 6.0.0 → dirs-sys 0.5.0 → option-ext 0.2.0`, and `option-ext` is
**MPL-2.0**. The license allowlist rejected it on the scaffold's first `cargo deny` run —
the gate paid for itself before a single line of domain code existed. The crate is on the
ban list now, with this note as the reason, so it cannot return by accident.

We need exactly two paths, both fixed by one paragraph of the XDG Base Directory
specification, on one platform. Vendoring a cross-platform path library to get them is a
worse trade than owning thirty lines.

**Retires when:** `directories` sheds `option-ext` (upstream has an open issue about it),
or the tool grows a real need for cross-platform path conventions.

---

## N3 — `std::thread::sleep` is banned workspace-wide, not just in tests

**Doc:** docs/4's `disallowed-methods` bans `std::thread::sleep` *in test code*.

**Repo:** `clippy.toml` is a workspace-global file with no notion of test-vs-not, so the
ban is global. Legitimate production sites (there are none yet; a settle backoff would be
one) take a narrow `#[expect(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "…")]`.

**Why:** the same one-home argument as N1. A global ban with named exceptions is auditable
— `grep` finds every exception and each carries a reason; a test-only ban is not.

**Retires when:** clippy grows per-target `disallowed-methods`.

---

## N4 — The D13 registry gained four variants

**Doc:** design D13 lists fourteen error variants and calls the registry closed.

**Repo:** `webcam-handler-schema::error::Error` has eighteen. The four additions:

| Variant | Why the fourteen could not cover it |
|---|---|
| `CameraUnknown { requested }` | `wch photo cam:nope` has to fail as something. D13 has `DeviceGone` (a camera that *was* there) but nothing for a name that never resolved. |
| `CameraAmbiguous { requested, candidates }` | D1 grants prefix resolution (`cam:obsbot`); a prefix matching two cameras must name both, and no existing variant carries candidates. |
| `DeviceIo { operation, errno, message }` | D13 maps `EBUSY`, `EPERM` and `ENODEV` to typed variants, which leaves every other `errno` — `EINVAL` on a format negotiation, `EIO` mid-stream — with nowhere to land except an `anyhow` string, and rubric B6 calls a string crossing the wire a finding. |
| `StorageIo { path, errno, message }` | D9's own fault menu lists "full disk", and the fourteen have no variant for a filesystem failure. |

**Why this is completion rather than re-litigation:** D13's stated purpose is that "every
variant carries what the caller needs to act", and the closed-ness is what makes the
`webcam-handler-api` code mapping exhaustive. Both additions of the `*Io` pair keep that
property — they are typed, they carry `errno` and the operation, and a caller can
distinguish them from a capability answer (E3). The alternative was a stringly escape
hatch, which would have broken the doctrine the registry exists to hold.

`ErrorKind` is generated with its `ALL` by the `closed_vocabulary!` macro, and
`Error::kind()` is an exhaustive match, so every one of the eighteen is walked by the
round-trip, rendering, and (from P4) RPC-code tests. Adding a nineteenth without wiring it
in does not compile.

**Retires when:** nothing retires it; docs/1 D13 should absorb these four at its next
revision. Recorded here rather than edited into the design because the design is v1 and
this is repo case law (docs/2's standing conventions).

---

## N5 — `webcam-handler-api` is exempt from the tokio half of the T6 wall

**Doc:** design §2.8 states the purity wall as "`schema`, `imaging`, `fake`, `api`,
`cli-core` link no tokio/axum/hyper", gate-asserted from `cargo metadata`.

**Repo:** `scripts/gates/dependency-walls.sh` applies the full three-crate ban to
`schema`, `imaging`, `fake` and `cli-core`. `webcam-handler-api` gets its own wall —
**no axum, no hyper, no tower-http** — and is allowed tokio.

**Why:** measured on 2026-08-08 against jsonrpsee 0.26.0, three feature sets built in a
scratch crate containing nothing but a `#[rpc(server, client)]` trait:

| `jsonrpsee` features | Result |
|---|---|
| `macros` | does not compile — the expansion needs `IntoResponse` and `RpcModule` |
| `macros`, `client-core` | does not compile — the server half is unresolved |
| `macros`, `server-core` | does not compile — the client half is unresolved |
| `macros`, `client-core`, `server-core` | compiles; `jsonrpsee-core → tokio` (`rt`, `sync`, `time`, `macros`) |

`jsonrpsee-core` activates tokio in *both* its `client` and `server` features, and the
macro's expansion references it. So a crate holding one `#[rpc(server, client)]` trait
links tokio, necessarily. Making the features optional on our side does not help either:
the two composition roots enable them and cargo unifies.

That leaves three options. Splitting the trait so client and server halves live in
separate crates would give us two wire surfaces, which is the thing D10/T5 exists to
prevent. Hand-rolling JSON-RPC is §7's recorded "shape of last resort" and costs us the
80% of jsonrpsee we actually use. Narrowing the wall costs us the least, provided the
narrowing is to exactly what the wall was protecting.

**What the wall was protecting**, read from §2.8's own sentence: "only `daemon` links the
web stack". That property is intact and now gate-asserted for `api` specifically —
measured today, `api` pulls no axum, no hyper, no tower. Tokio arriving as a transitive
library dependency of a JSON-RPC codec is not the defect the rule was written against;
`wchc` linking hyper would be, and that half still fails loudly.

**What is not covered:** that `api` never *starts* a runtime or spawns a task. Linkage
cannot see that. It joins the behavioral halves of T6 that §2.8 already declares
review-held — so this note widens the review surface by one claim rather than pretending
the gate grew.

**Retires when:** jsonrpsee splits a runtime-free core out of `jsonrpsee-core`, or the
wire surface stops being jsonrpsee. Re-run the table above on any jsonrpsee bump; if a
version makes the original wall satisfiable, delete the exemption and this note.

## PF:13 — `bus_info` is per-USB-device, not per-logical-camera

**Measured** 2026-08-08 on kernel 7.0.0-29-generic, against the same seed hardware as the
docs/1 §1.2 registry. Continues that registry; cite it as `[PF:13]`.

`VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` reports `bus_info` for both Chicony logical cameras as the identical
string `usb-0000:00:14.0-4`, even though they are separate USB *interfaces* (`3-4:1.0` RGB
and `3-4:1.2` IR) hosting separate capture nodes with different formats. The card names do
differ (`Integrated Camera: Integrated C` vs `… Integrated I`), but that is the vendor's
courtesy, not a guarantee.

**Consequences, both load-bearing:**

1. **Grouping must come from the sysfs USB interface path**, never from `bus_info` —
   PF:7's rule, now with the counter-example that shows why the easier field does not
   work. Two cameras that share `bus_info` would collapse into one group.
2. **`CameraFingerprint::bus_path` holds the interface path** (`3-4:1.2`), not `bus_info`.
   A fingerprint built on `bus_info` could not tell the IR camera from the RGB one, and
   `calibrate apply` would happily replay an IR session onto the RGB sensor.

Measured node facts, for the P1 enumeration tests:

| Node | Interface | `device_caps` | Kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| video0 | 3-4:1.0 | `0x04200001` | capture (Chicony RGB) |
| video1 | 3-4:1.0 | `0x04a00000` | metadata |
| video2 | 3-4:1.2 | `0x04200001` | capture (Chicony IR) |
| video3 | 3-4:1.2 | `0x04a00000` | metadata |
| video4 | 3-1:1.0 | `0x04200001` | capture (OBSBOT Tiny 3) |
| video5 | 3-1:1.0 | `0x04a00000` | metadata |

USB ids: Chicony `04f2:b83c` serial `"0001"`; OBSBOT `3564:ff02`, no serial — PF:8 holds.

**Retires when:** never, unless the kernel starts reporting per-interface `bus_info`. It
becomes corpus at P1, where the three committed profiles pin these node tables.

## N6 — D13 gained a nineteenth variant, `Unimplemented`, and it is scheduled to die

**Doc:** docs/1 D13 lists the error registry; note N4 already recorded four additions and
argued each was *completion* of the registry's stated purpose rather than a new escape
hatch. Design §2.3 states the T1/T2 traits as total: `Camera` has eight methods and every
backend implements all eight.

**Repo:** `webcam-handler-schema::error::Error` has nineteen variants. The new one is

```rust
Unimplemented { operation: String, arrives_in: String }
```

and at P1 it is returned by exactly five methods — `Camera::{set, start_stream,
next_frame, stop_stream}` (which arrive at P2) and `CameraBackend::watch` (P4).

**Why:** docs/2 splits one *total* trait across three phases. P1 lands the V4L2 read path;
the write path is P2's and hotplug is P4's, each with its own gate. But the trait must be
total to compile at P1, so the four-and-one methods that have not landed must return
something, and every other candidate is a lie:

| Candidate | Why it is worse |
|---|---|
| `panic!`/`todo!` | "plugging in a webcam cannot panic the library" is the whole reason this crate exists (PF:1). A panic is also banned on device-driven paths by the crate's lint set. |
| `Error::DeviceIo` | blames the kernel for our release schedule. A bug report filed against `uvcvideo` is a real cost. |
| `Error::FormatUnsupported` with an empty list | a **capability** answer. E3's entire subject is that "the camera can't" and "we didn't" must never be spelled the same way. |
| Implementing the write path early | over-scoping; G2's criteria — clamp warnings, read-back, the guarded-set planner — are where writes are proven, and landing them unproven at P1 would put them past their gate rather than before it. |
| Splitting the trait so P1 implements a narrower one | two backend contracts instead of one, which is what T1/T2 exists to prevent, and `wch` would need a backend-specific path — the exact "one home" violation §2.10 forbids. |

**Why this is not the escape hatch N4 warned about:** it is typed, it carries the two
things a caller acts on (which operation, which phase), and it says *this build* rather
than *this device*. `schema`'s own test asserts the rendering names the build and the
phase, and asserts the kind is distinct from `DeviceIo`.

**What keeps it honest:** `webcam-handler-v4l2::unimplemented_surface()` is the one list
of methods that answer it, and a test pins the list's size and contents. P2 cannot land
its four without editing that test, and when the fifth goes at P4 the function has no
rows left. The variant is therefore scheduled to become unconstructed.

**Retires when:** P4 closes and no crate constructs it. At that point deleting the variant
is a one-line change that the exhaustive `Error::kind` match will drive.

## PF:14 — A UVC camera's VideoStreaming interface never has a V4L2 binding

**Measured** 2026-08-08 on kernel 7.0.0-29-generic against the docs/1 §1.2 seed hardware.
Continues that registry; cite it as `[PF:14]`.

D1 requires `list` to diagnose an empty enumeration rather than shrug at it: scan for USB
video-class interfaces with no `video4linux` binding and report "USB camera present
without a V4L2 driver". Implemented as literally written — *per interface* — that check
reports **every healthy camera on this machine** as driverless.

`/sys/bus/usb/devices`, with `bInterfaceClass` and the presence of a `video4linux/`
subdirectory:

| Interface | `bInterfaceClass` | `bInterfaceSubClass` | `video4linux/` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `3-4:1.0` | `0e` | `01` (VideoControl) | `video0`, `video1` |
| `3-4:1.1` | `0e` | `02` (VideoStreaming) | **absent** |
| `3-4:1.2` | `0e` | `01` (VideoControl) | `video2`, `video3` |
| `3-4:1.3` | `0e` | `02` (VideoStreaming) | **absent** |
| `3-1:1.0` | `0e` | `01` (VideoControl) | `video4`, `video5` |
| `3-1:1.1` | `0e` | `02` (VideoStreaming) | **absent** |

A UVC device exposes both halves of the class. `uvcvideo` binds the VideoControl interface
and hangs the capture nodes off it; the VideoStreaming interface is claimed by the same
driver but carries no `video4linux` directory of its own. Three cameras, all working,
three interfaces that look unbound.

**Consequence:** the question is asked **per USB device**, not per interface. A device is
diagnosed as driverless when it presents at least one video-class interface and *none* of
its interfaces has a V4L2 binding. Filtering on `bInterfaceSubClass == 01` would also work
today, but it encodes more of the UVC descriptor layout than the diagnosis needs — the
user's question is "is something driving this camera", and that is a property of the
device.

The false-positive direction is the one that matters: a wrong hint appears exactly when
`list` is *not* empty of real cameras on other buses, i.e. when the user is least likely
to question it. `sysfs::unbound_video_devices_in` is tested in both directions, and a live
test asserts that a host with V4L2 nodes diagnoses nothing.

**Retires when:** `uvcvideo` starts binding nodes to the VideoStreaming interface, or the
diagnosis moves to a source that reports driver binding directly.

---

## N7 — `CameraBackend` gained a fifth method, `diagnose`

**Doc:** design §2.3 states T1 as four methods — `name`, `enumerate`, `open`, `watch` —
and calls the trait "the pluggability seam". Separately, D1 requires that "an empty
enumeration is diagnosed, not shrugged at": `list` with zero cameras is to scan sysfs for
USB video-class interfaces with no video4linux binding and report "USB camera present
without a V4L2 driver".

**Repo:** `CameraBackend` has a fifth method with a default body:

```rust
fn diagnose(&self) -> Vec<crate::report::ListHint> { Vec::new() }
```

`webcam-handler-v4l2` overrides it with the PF:14 scan; `webcam-handler-fake` inherits the
empty default.

**Why:** D1's requirement needs a channel, and the two alternatives are both worse.

- *Put the scan in the client.* Then something above the seam has to know it is holding a
  V4L2 backend, which means a second exhaustive `match` on `BackendKind` — the "second
  home" §2.10 calls a defect, in a codebase whose composition roots exist precisely so
  that match happens once.
- *Return the hints from `enumerate`.* That changes the signature every backend and every
  caller already uses, to carry a field almost every call ignores, and makes "the cameras"
  and "why there might be fewer than you expect" one value when they are two facts.

A defaulted method costs a backend that has nothing to say exactly nothing, which is the
honest position for one replaying a document: the fake's enumeration is complete by
construction, so it has no absence to explain.

**Why this is completion rather than re-litigation:** §2.3's stated purpose for T1 is that
the engine consumes backends without naming them. Adding `diagnose` *serves* that purpose —
without it, the one thing D1 asks for could only be built by naming one. The method takes
and returns schema values like every other, and adds no policy: `ListHint::message` renders
the sentence once, in `webcam-handler-schema`, so the CLI and the daemon cannot describe the
same finding differently.

**What it does not do:** it is not a general "backend status" channel. `HintKind` is a
closed vocabulary with one variant, and a second one needs the same justification this one
had — a requirement in the design that cannot otherwise be met.

**Retires when:** nothing retires it; docs/1 §2.3 should absorb the method at its next
revision, as N4 says of the four error variants.
